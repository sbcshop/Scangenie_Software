### 1. Configure and Setup Development Environment
   - Download Arduino IDE from [official site](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) and install into your system. We have use Arduino IDE 1.8.19
   - Once installation done will add ESP32 S3 board support into IDE, for this first you need to add below link into preference:
     
     ```
     https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_index.json
     ```
     
     Select File > Preference, and add link as show in below image,
      <img src= "https://github.com/sbcshop/3.2_Touchsy_ESP-32_Resistive_Software/blob/main/images/preference_board.gif" />
      
   - Now will install ESP32 based boards as shown in below image,

     <img src= "https://github.com/sbcshop/3.2_Touchsy_ESP-32_Resistive_Software/blob/main/images/install_ESP32boards.gif" />
     
   - Once done, keeping default settings select the ESP32S3 Dev Module with suitable com port (may be different in your case) as shown below, 

     <img src="https://github.com/sbcshop/3.2_Touchsy_ESP-32_Resistive_Software/blob/main/images/select_esp32_with_comport.gif">
     
     
### 2. Installing Libraries
   - Download [library zip file](https://github.com/sbcshop/Scangenie_Software/blob/main/libraries.zip) provided here in github.
   - Extract and copy files inside Document > Arduino > Libraries folder. Make sure to restart Arduino IDE whenever you update or add any libraries.

### 3. Testing First Code
   - At this step you are all set to test codes, for easy getting started we have provided various demo [example codes](https://github.com/sbcshop/Scangenie_Software/tree/main/examples) in github which you can download and try. 
   - Open one example code in Arduino and make sure you have selected correct board with suitable com port, click on upload button to transfer code on ESP32 of Scangenie.
     <img src="https://github.com/sbcshop/3.2_Touchsy_ESP-32_Resistive_Software/blob/main/images/upload_process.gif">
   - Checkout other examples below and build your own custom program codes using those references.

### Example Codes

For testing any of Scanner code listed in this section your device needs to be in TTL mode, if yes then proceed with example or else follow steps mentioned [here](https://github.com/sbcshop/Scangenie_Software/blob/main/README.md#mode-setup) in GitHub.

   - [Example 1](https://github.com/sbcshop/Scangenie_Software/tree/main/examples/Demo_Display) : Display Demo code
   - [Example 2](https://github.com/sbcshop/Scangenie_Software/tree/main/examples/Demo_Scanner_Button) : Scanning Barcode/QR Code using Scan Button
   - [Example 3](https://github.com/sbcshop/Scangenie_Software/tree/main/examples/Demo_Scanner_automatic) : Automatic Scanning Barcode/QR code after regular interval of Time

   Now you are ready to try out your own codes, **_Happy Coding!_**

### Mode Setup
- **TTL Mode**

  TTL mode is default mode in which DE2120 Scanner will work in co-ordination with ESP32 controller of ScanGenie using UART communication. If in case your device mode is different you can follow below steps to get device into TTL mode. 

  - First step Scan the below barcode by Pressing onboard Scan button of ScanGenie. This will put device into TTL mode
    
    <img src="https://github.com/sbcshop/Pi-Barcode-HAT/raw/main/images/ttl_rs232.JPG">
    
  - Now to set Baud Rate 9600 by scanning below Barcode, even you can set different Baud Rate by refering Manual provided in this repo.
    
    <img src="https://github.com/sbcshop/Pi-Barcode-HAT/raw/main/images/baudrate.JPG">
    
  - **TTL mode is required** if you want **to try** various **code example** provided in this GitHub repo.
  
  
- **USB-KBW Mode**

  You can also use this ScanGenie with USB cable for reading Barcode/Scanner without onboard ESP32 controller board.

  - Connect type C cable to "Barcode" side instead of "PROG" and other end to your laptop/PC.

  - Now simply scan the below Barcode and so this will set board into USB keyboard mode.
    
    <img src="https://github.com/sbcshop/Pi-Barcode-HAT/raw/main/images/img7.JPG">
    
  - In USB keyboard mode, you just need to open a notepad/word like application and scan any barcode or QR-code to get their number in your system. As shown in image below
    
    <img src="https://github.com/sbcshop/Zero-Barcode-Hat/raw/main/images/SC.PNG" width="539" height="311">
    
  The DE2120 is completely user configurable, you can configure many settings according to your requirement by refering the DE2120 Manual(Barcode manual) provided in this Repo.
