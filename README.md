### 1. Configure and Setup Development Environment
   - Download Arduino IDE from [official site](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) and install into your system. We have use Arduino IDE 1.8.19
   - Once installation done will add ESP32 S3 board support into IDE, for this first you need to add below link into preference:
     
     ```
     https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_index.json
     ```
     
     Select File > Preference, and add link as show in below image,
      <img src= "https://github.com/sbcshop/3.2_Touchsy_ESP-32_Resistive_Software/blob/main/images/preference_board.gif" />
      
   - Now will install ESP32 based boards as shown in below image,

     <img src= "https://github.com/sbcshop/3.2_Touchsy_ESP-32_Resistive_Software/blob/main/images/install_ESP32boards.gif" />
     
   - Once done, keeping default settings select the ESP32S3 Dev Module with suitable com port (may be different in your case) as shown below,

### 2. Installing Libraries
   - Download [library zip file]() provided here in github.
   - Extract and copy files inside Document > Arduino > Libraries folder. Make sure to restart Arduino IDE whenever you update or add any libraries.

### 3. Testing First Code
   - At this step you are all set to test codes, for easy getting started we have provided various demo [example codes]() in github which you can download and try. 
   - Open one example code in Arduino and make sure you have selected correct board with suitable com port, click on upload button to transfer code on ESP32 of Scangenie.
     <img src="https://github.com/sbcshop/3.2_Touchsy_ESP-32_Resistive_Software/blob/main/images/upload_process.gif">
   - Checkout other examples below and build your own custom program codes using those references.

### Example Codes
   - [Example 1]() : Display Demo code
   - [Example 2]() : Scanning Barcode/QR Code using Scan Button
   - [Example 3]() : Automatic Scanning Barcode/QR code after regular interval of Time
   - and [Many more...]()

   Now you are ready to try out your own codes, **_Happy Coding!_**
